# Overview

The DataLbry Connector SDK helps developer to deliver Connectors for the DataLbry Knowledge Cloud faster and easier. 
It primarily helps with the source system traversal and providing a robust scaffold for the integration.

The Connector SDk itself is rather sophisticated and might not work for all kinds of integrations, as it primarily works with an information graph within the source system. Potential supported integrations are primarily hierarchical and stable systems such as Atlassian Confluence, Microsoft SharePoint, or even Databases such as Postgresql. While event based systems, such as Kafka, Google Pub/Sub and more, are not very likely to be easily integrated with the Connector SDK
