# Connector-SDK

The `Connector-SDK` is a sophisticated framework to develop `Connector Integrations`.

A `Connector Integration` is a application, fetching data from a system, transform it briefly and put it into 
another system. It can be considered as an `ETL` / `ELT` tool, while not enabling the user to transform the data.
